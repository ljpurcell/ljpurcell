Hi, Iâ€™m @ljpurcell ðŸ‘‹

- __General:__ For the longest time I have been interested in bettering myself -- with a specific focus on becoming more knowledgeable, rational, and moral. I am far from achiveing this goal but I enjoy the process of improvement.

- __Technical:__ I find the most joy working on the back-end of projects. While I am still trying develop a fullstack skillset, I am particularly intrigued (and motivated) by efficient and elegant solutions. I think speed and performance are often underrated facets of developing a good user-exeperience.

- __Work:__ I am a software developer at [OK200](https://ok200.net/) in Melbourne. It's good fun!

- __Currently learning:__ Anything that will aid my development and long-term potential as a developer. This includes gaining exposure to new problems, programming languages, and paradigms; learning more about how computers work and how they can be better utilised; algorithms & data-structures; and other foundational topics like mathematics and statistics.

- __When I'm not programming:__ I am thinking about programming, reading a book, writing for my blog, or potentially with my friends at a rave because, for some reason, _I genuinely like the music_.
