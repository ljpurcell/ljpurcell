Hi, Iâ€™m @ljpurcell ðŸ‘‹

- __General:__ Self-improvement and rationality enthusiast. 

- __Technical interests:__ I find the most joy building tools, automating tasks, or working on the server-side. In my personal time I mostly write Go and Python. 

- __Work:__ I am a software developer at [OK200](https://ok200.net/) in Melbourne. It's good fun!

- __Currently learning:__ Anything that will aid my development and long-term potential as a programmer.

- __When I'm not programming:__ I am thinking about programming, reading a book, watching cartoons, writing for my blog, or potentially with my friends at a rave because, for some reason, _I genuinely like the music_.
