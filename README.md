Hi, Iâ€™m @ljpurcell ðŸ‘‹

- __General:__ For as long as I can remember I have been interested in improving myself. I try to end each day knowing I have learned a new skill, made the world a little better or understand reality more deeply.

- __Technical interests:__ I find the most joy building automation tools or working on the the back-end of projects. I am intrigued, and motivated, by efficincy -- as opposed to crafting the most beautiful user-interface. While I still enjoy fullstack programming, I think speed and performance are often underrated facets of developing a good user-exeperience. I enjoy being able to focus my efforts on that.

- __Work:__ I am a software developer at [OK200](https://ok200.net/) in Melbourne. It's good fun!

- __Currently learning:__ Anything that will aid my development and long-term potential as a programmer. This includes gaining exposure to new problems, languages, and paradigms; learning more about how computers work and how they can be better utilised; algorithms & data-structures; and other foundational topics like mathematics and statistics.

- __When I'm not programming:__ I am thinking about programming, reading a book, watching cartoons, writing for my blog, or potentially with my friends at a rave because, for some reason, _I genuinely like the music_.
