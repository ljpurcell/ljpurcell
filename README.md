Hi, Iâ€™m @ljpurcell ðŸ‘‹

- __General:__ I tend to become fascinated by practically _everything_. I'm a life-long bookworm, enjoy philosophical conversations, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to think better. I'm perpetually interested in bettering myself by becoming more knowledgeable, rational, and moral. 

- __Technical:__ While I am still trying to develop a range of fullstack skills, I find the most joy working on the back-end of projects. In my personal time I mostly program using Python and profesionally it is PHP and JS.

- __Currently learning:__ Anything that will aid my development and long-term potential as a developer. This includes gaining exposure to new problems, programming languages, and paradigms; learning more about how computers work and how they can be better utilised; algorithms & data-structures; and other foundational topics like mathematics and statistics.

- __Work:__ I am a software developer at [OK200](https://ok200.net/) in Melbourne. We mostly build products using a combination of Laravel and Vue.js. It's good fun!
