Hi, Iâ€™m @ljpurcell ðŸ‘‹

- __Interests:__ Iâ€™m quite curious, so I tend to become interested in practically _everything_. I'm a life-long bookworm, enjoy philosophical conversations, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to think better. Generally speaking, I'm interested in bettering myself by becoming more knowledgeable, rational, and moral. I intend to use these virtues to help the world.

- __Currently learning:__ A variety of things -- anything that will hopefully aid my development and long-term potential. I'm still quite new to software development, so my enthusiasm-to-experience ratio is highly skewed. But, in general, I'm trying to do anything that will help me become a better programmer. This includes gaining exposure to new problems, programming languages, and paradigms; learning more about how computers work and how they can be better utilised; algorithms & data-structures; increasing my machine learning and data science skillset; and other foundational topics like mathematics and statistics.
