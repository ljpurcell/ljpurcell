- Hi, Iâ€™m @ljpurcell ðŸ‘‹

- __Interests:__ Iâ€™m quite curious and deep-thinking, so I tend to become interested in practically _everything_. 
  Some interests are much more intense than others, however, and currently programming and machine learning top that list.
  I taught myself some basic programming during COVID-19 lockdowns, and fell so in love with it that I decided to re-enroll at university
  for an undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence. (This was no small decision, after already doing two exercise science degrees.)
  I'm still only a few years into the process, but really enjoying it. I can already appreciate just how far my skills and knowledge have come.

- __Currently learning:__ A variety of things -- anything that will hopefully aid my development and long-term potential. 
  This includes becoming a better programmer in general; increasing my machine learning and data science skillset; and other foundational topics like mathematics and statistics.
 
- __Goals:__ I would like to start contributing to open-source projects and hopefully get myself into some software developer/machine learning engineer internships.
A lot of my learning takes place in a solo, isolated manner and I would love to begin to gain learning from others and gain "real-world" experience. 
I think this would be very additive to my academic efforts.
