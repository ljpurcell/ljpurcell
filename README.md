Hi, Iâ€™m @ljpurcell ðŸ‘‹

- __Interests:__ Iâ€™m quite curious, so I tend to become interested in practically _everything_. I'm a life-long bookworm, enjoy philosophical conversations, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to think better. Generally speaking, I'm interested in bettering myself by becoming more knowledgeable, rational, and moral. I intend to use these virtues to help the world.
  
- __What brings me here:__ While I have many interest, some interests are more intense than others. Currently, programming and machine learning top that list.
  I taught myself some basic programming during COVID-19 lockdowns, and fell so in love with it that I decided to re-enroll at university
  for an undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence. (This was no small decision, after already having done _two_ exercise science degrees and having _no_ exposure to programming/computer science prior to 2020.)
  I'm only a few years into the process, but loving it. I can already appreciate just how far my skills and knowledge have come.

- __Currently learning:__ A variety of things -- anything that will hopefully aid my development and long-term potential. 
  This includes becoming a better programmer through exposure to new problems, programming languages, and paradigms; learning more about how computers work and how they can be better utilised; increasing my machine learning and data science skillset; and other foundational topics like mathematics and statistics.
 
- __Goals:__ I would like to start contributing to open-source projects and hopefully get myself into some software developer/machine learning engineer internships (so if you know of anything suitable, please let me know :grin:).
A lot of my learning takes place in a solo, isolated manner and I would love to begin learning from others and gaining "real-world" experience. 
I think this would be very additive to my academic efforts.
